Why rely on social media alone at such a pivotal time?'Black Lives Matter. Including Bravo talent and viewership. Bravo has a platform and a voice. Own it,' the fans urged.Braunwyn shared the message in a since-deleted Instagram Story and noted that 'they have a point' before the RHOC star tagged Bravo's account handle.The network announced on Friday that it will stream the special to 'amplify activism' on their social media page, but has not yet made a change to air it on TV.Porsha, 38, has attended multiple BLM protests in her hometown of Atlanta, Georgia and posted powerful images last week.7 Porsha attended multiple protests in Atlanta this week Credit: InstagramShe wore a face mask while speaking to news reporters Credit: CBS467 RHOP star Gizelle proudly showed off her homemade sign during a protest Credit: Instagram'I saw people who were my age who felt the energy of it. I suggest that you go within your lifetime - this is what we're dealing with.'This is how you be a part of it. I suggest that you do be a part of a peaceful march in your community.'When I went out, what I witnessed was young people who were very intelligent. They had a message. They were articulate,' she said of the next generation.Gizelle, 49, attended a protest last week and proudly showed off a homemade sign that read: 'No justice, no peace.'7 Kandi will join her cast mates for Mondays livestream Credit: Getty Images - GettyMost Read in Entertainment 'BOSS BABE' Mackenzie McKee buys new car with cash after reuniting with 'cheating' husband 'I STARTED CRYING' Teen Mom's Jo Rivera rushes daughter to ER with pom pom up her nose BIG PROBLEM Audrey Roloff says she's 'weathered a shame storm' after in-law Jacob's attack LEGEND LOST Grammy-winning Motown singer Bonnie Pointer of the Pointer Sisters dead at 69 STAYING STRONG Glee star Becca Tobin 'not ashamed' her 'vagina was all over internet' AL FRESCO Alessandra Ambrosio flaunts her amazing figure while relaxing in a swimming pool'My girls made our signs and wanted to be the 1st ones there. You have to talk to your children so that they understand because they too want their voices heard,' the RHOP star added.Kandi, 44, said last week that the 'unnecessary killings of African Americans has become all to common.'She urged that 'it has got to stop,' alongside a picture of George Floyd.Bravo has not yet returned The Sun's request for comment.The Amplify Our Voices event on the 'open dialogue on being black in America' will be live streamed on Monday, Jun 8 at 7pm EST on Bravo's Instagram.</th>\n",
